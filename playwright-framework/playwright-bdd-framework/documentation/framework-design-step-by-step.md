# Playwright BDD framework - step by step 

## 1. Creating a local working directory within the workspace. (playwright-bdd-framework)
goto terminal => cd playwright-bdd-framework

## 2. Install necessary dependencies based on our project requirements. 
1. **Playwright** — `npm init playwright@latest` (or add `@playwright/test`) for web / API automation with the Playwright Test runner.
2. **TypeScript** — `npm install typescript ts-node @types/node` and `npx tsc --init` for language support.
3. **Excel** — `npm install excel xlsx` to read or work with spreadsheet data.
4. **PDF** — `npm install pdf-parse` and (in this project) `pdf-parse-new` for PDF utilities.
5. **PostgreSQL** — `npm install pg @types/pg` to connect to a database from tests or helpers.
6. **Cucumber** - `npm install @cucumber/cucumber` To set up Cucumber BDD framework and to integrate feature-while step definitions with Playwright configurations 

## 3. Set up the global configurations within the package.json and tsconfig.json. 
1. package.json => "type" : "module"
2. tsconfig.json => "noEmit": true
3. tsconfig.json => "allowImportingTsExtensions": true    

## 4. Setup the folder structure to maintain different components of the framework. 
1. commons => To maintain the common methods related to UI, API, database, and load testing 
2. config => To maintain the configuration data like application URLs, API URLs, credentials, and other common configurations 
3. files => To maintain flat files like PDF, Excel, etc. 
4. features => To maintain Cucumber feature files for UI, API database, and load testing related validations 
5. step-definitions => To maintain step definition for each and every step written in the Cucumber Feature file 
6. utils =>  To maintain all the common utilities and helper methods to integrate different TypeScript libraries useful in day-to-day automation 
7. page-objects => To maintain page-wise locators and page-wise common methods separately to implement page object model design pattern 
8. testdata => To maintain the additional test data along with the data added in the feature file 
9. screenshots => To maintain all the screenshots related to failure test cases 
10. reports => To maintain all the test results report every time when test execution is complete 
11. support => To maintain the hooks and world file related to Cucumber configurations to link feature files and step definitions 

## 5. Setup the cucumber configurations
Create cucumber.CJS file to maintain the configurations related to the feature files, step definitions, and test results report that needs to be generated every time. 
module.exports = {
  default: {
    paths: ['features/**/*.feature'], 
    loader: ['ts-node/esm'],
    import: ['support/**/*.ts', 'step-definitions/**/*.ts'],
    format: ['progress-bar', 'html:reports/cucumber-report.html'],
    publishQuiet: true
  }
};
